                        In Two Rooms and a Boom there are 2 teams and 2 rooms. The 2 teams are the Blue Team and the Red
                        Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team has a Bomber. Players are first equally
                        distributed between 2 separate playing areas (usually
                        2 separate rooms) and then each player is randomly dealt a facedown character card.

                        Players play the game by saying what they want in order to select a leader for their room. The
                        leader chooses hostages (players who will be sent to the other room at the end of the round).

                    <Typography>
                        The game consists of 3 timed rounds. Each round is shorter than the previous round. At the end
                        of each round, the hostages selected by the leaders will be traded into opposing rooms.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography>
                        The game ends after the last hostage exchange.

                        Everyone reveals their card. If Red Teamâ€™s Bomber is in the same room as the President, then the
                        Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue Team wins.
